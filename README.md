## Description

Music.Me is a music resource application that focuses on representation in the music industry, specifically providing a resource for those seeking out under-represented groups in media. We want Music.Me to help individuals find Musicians in which they see themselves.

Our app allows users to search for musicians and find a sampling of their tracks AS WELL AS showcasing a directory focused on artists from marginalized groups pertaining to one or more of the following categories: 
Persons of color
