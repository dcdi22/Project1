# Music.Me
Music.Me is a music resource application that focuses on representation in the music industry, specifically providing a resource for those seeking out under-represented groups in media. We want Music.Me to help individuals find Musicians in which they see themselves.

Our app allows users to search for musicians and find a sampling of their tracks AS WELL AS showcasing a directory focused on artists from marginalized groups pertaining to one or more of the following categories: 
Persons of color 
LGBT persons 
& Women

To help in the discovery process we've also included the 'random button' that will pull in an artist from the database and display information about them as well as begin playing a sampling of their music.
